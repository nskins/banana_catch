# Banana Catch

THIS IS ABSOLUTELY ASTOUNDING! BANANAS ARE FALLING FROM THE SKY! QUICK! YOU NEED TO CATCH AS MANY AS YOU CAN! THE FATE OF THE WORLD DEPENDS ON YOU!

## How to Build

In order to build the source code, you will need to have [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) installed.

You may also need to install dependencies for the [Bevy game engine](https://bevyengine.org/learn/book/getting-started/setup/#install-os-dependencies).

After that, just run `cargo run` in the source directory.
